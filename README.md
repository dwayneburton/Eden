# Eden
For my Project Studio Design course at the University of Waterloo, I created Eden, an environmental scanner for planting purposes. Using an STM32 Nucleo Board and the STM32CubeIDE, I designed algorithms for a Temperature/Humidity sensor and a Photoresistor to receive data and output the information to an LCD screen in a user-friendly format **(C)**.
